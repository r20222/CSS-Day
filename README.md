# About the project 🎨

My teacher Krijn, from my study Frontend Design & Development at the University of Applied Sciences in Amsterdam, gave us the assignment to make a website with the JSON data from the CSS day of the past 10 years. With this assignment we could win a ticket for the CSS Day 2024! And Im very excited and happy that I have won a ticket with my project and that I will be attending CSS Day 2024! 🥳
